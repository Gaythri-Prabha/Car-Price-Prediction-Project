# Car-Price-Prediction-Project
This project aims to predict car prices in the American market using machine learning models. Various regression techniques were applied to identify key factors affecting car prices and determine the most accurate predictive model.
Steps Covered
✔ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing data.
✔ Feature Selection: Identifying the most significant variables impacting car prices.
✔ Model Implementation: Comparing Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regressor.
✔ Evaluation Metrics: Assessing models using R², MSE, and MAE.
✔ Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the best model for improved performance.

🔍 Key Insights
✅ Random Forest Regressor emerged as the best model with an R² of 0.958 and the lowest error metrics.
✅ Engine Size, Horsepower, and Curb Weight were the most influential factors in price prediction.
✅ Hyperparameter tuning further enhanced model accuracy and reduced errors.
